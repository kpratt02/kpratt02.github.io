Background
</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Kiley Pratt, and I am junior at Tufts University. I am currently pursuing a degree in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, with minors 
in Computer Science and Food Systems and Nutrition. I am currently spending a semester abroad in Nantes, France on a language immersion program. At Tufts, I served as the Gear Director and Historian for the Tufts Mountain Club, Partnerships Director and Grassroots On-site intern with GlobeMed at Tufts, assistant program coordinator for Tufts Wilderness Orientation, and run with the Tufts Marathon Team. When not hiking, I also enjoy skiing in my home state of Vermont, playing music, or drinking lattes in obscure cafes to try and find the best one. This site is a work in progress and was the result of a class taken in Web Development last semester; feel free to check back as I continue to update it!</p>
