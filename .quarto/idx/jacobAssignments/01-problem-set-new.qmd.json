{"title":"Problem set 1","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Problem set 1","date":"2022-08-29"},"headingText":"Task 1: Introduce yourself to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = \"center\")\n```\n\n\n1. Go the the example page for this week, [\"Welcome to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse\"](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd), and work through the different primers and videos in the four parts of the page.\n\n    It seems like there's a lot on the page, but they're short and go fairly quickly (especially as you get the hang of the syntax). Also, **I have no way of seeing what you do or what you get wrong or right, and that's totally fine!** If you get stuck and want to skip some (or if it gets too easy), go right ahead and skip them!\n\n\n## Task 2: Make an RStudio Project\n\n1. Use either RStudio.cloud or RStudio on your computer (preferably RStudio on your computer! [Follow these instructions to get started!](/resource/install.qmd)) to create a new RStudio Project. Refer to the [example page you read in Task 1 for instructions](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd#part-3-rstudio-projects)\n\n2. Create a folder named \"data\" in the project folder you just made.\n\n3. Download this CSV file and place it in that folder:\n\n    - [{{< fa file-csv >}} `cars.csv`](/files/data/package_data/cars.csv)\n\n4. In RStudio, go to \"File\" > \"New File…\" > \"R Markdown…\" and click \"OK\" in the dialog without changing anything.\n\n5. Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it with this:\n\n````{verbatim, indent=\"    \"}\n---\ntitle: \"Problem set 1\"\nauthor: \"Put your name here\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r load-libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ncars <- read_csv(\"data/cars.csv\")\n```\n\n# Learning R\n\nTell me that you worked through the primers and videos and examples at the example page for this week:\n\nWRITE SOMETHING HERE LIKE \"I did all the primers and had the time of my life!\" or whatever.\n\n\n# My first plots\n\nInsert a chunk below and use it to create a scatterplot (hint: `geom_point()`) with diplacement (`displ`) on the x-axis, city MPG (`cty`) on the y-axis, and with the points colored by drive (`drv`).\n\nPUT CHUNK HERE\n\nInsert a chunk below and use it to create a histogram (hint: `geom_histogram()`) with highway MPG (`hwy`) on the x-axis. Do not include anything on the y-axis (`geom_histogram()` will do that automatically for you). Choose an appropriate bin width. If you're brave, facet by drive (`drv`).\n\nPUT CHUNK HERE\n\n\n# My first data manipulation\n\nInsert a chunk below and use it to calculate the average city MPG (`cty`) by class of car (`class`). This won't be a plot---it'll be a table. Hint: use a combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n\nPUT CHUNK HERE\n````\n\n6. Save the R Markdown file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**)\n\n7. Your project folder should look something like this:\n\n```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"30%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/assignments/project-structure.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n## Task 3: Work with R\n\n1. Remove the text that says \"PUT CHUNK HERE\" and insert a new R code chunk. Either type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS, or use the \"Insert Chunk\" menu:\n\n```{r insert-chunk-button, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"19%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/assignments/insert-chunk-button.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\n2. Follow the instructions for the three chunks of code.\n\n3. Knit your document as a Word file (or PDF if you're brave and [installed LaTeX](/resource/install.qmd#install-tinytex)). Use the \"Knit\" menu:\n\n```{r knit-button, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"30%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/assignments/knit-button.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\n4. Upload the knitted document to iCollege.\n\n5. `r emoji::emoji(\"tada\")` Party! `r emoji::emoji(\"tada\")`\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\nYou'll be doing this same process for all your future problem sets. Each problem set will involve an R Markdown file. You can either create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work:\n\n```{r single-directory, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"30%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/reference/rproj-one-folder.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\nOr you can create individual projects for each assignment and project:\n\n```{r multiple-directories, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"30%\",}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/files/img/reference/rproj-multiple-folders.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = \"center\")\n```\n\n## Task 1: Introduce yourself to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse\n\n1.
